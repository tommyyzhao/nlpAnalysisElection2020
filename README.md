# Natural Language Analysis of Twitter for the 2020 United States Presidential Election

This analysis was done as part of the DS340W Applied Data Science course. In this repository, you will find the iPython notebooks (we used Google Colab) as well as some sample data. The raw data is unfortunately too big to be included on Github.

Abstract—Over the past decade, Twitter has become a key
area for (Western) political discourse via its system of Tweets
and followers. Tweets are composed of unstructured natural
language which beckons the use of natural language processing
(NLP) tools to analyze it. A great deal of latent information
about the world, trends, and underlying demographics of Twitter
can be accessed through these Tweets with varying effectiveness
depending on the NLP technique. Information from Tweets is
particularly valuable with regard to politics, which data scientists
have been trying to crack since the early 2010s. The past few
years have seen numerous breakthroughs in NLP, offering novel
and effective techniques whose potential in extracting useful
information from Twitter have yet to be fully explored. We apply
modern NLP techniques and models to the task of gaining insight
regarding the Twitter landscape in the week leading up to the
2020 US Presidential Elections. Through sentiment classification,
tone, and topic modeling, our results suggest key differences on
Twitter between the 2016 and 2020 election years, such as more
negative sentiment on average in the 2016 election compared
with 2020. We compare two techniques for sentiment analysis,
a Naive Bayes classifier and a state-of-the-art classifier from the
flairNLP Python package. Our results indicate that improvements
in NLP and machine learning will continue to enhance our ability
to extract meaningful information from natural language ”data
mines” such as Twitter.
